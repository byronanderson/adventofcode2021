Advent of code solutions for 2021!

I enjoy doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the last few years and this year I am starting with solutions in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/).

I use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) with [erlang](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang) and [gleam](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-gleam) plugins to setup my development environment,
then from the `gleam_advent` directory run `gleam run` to execute the day associated to the commit.
